## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks. 

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, and share** code. 
A good __Cloud Engineer__ uses Codeblocks whenever possible. 

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues. 

- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks (`)
- Not to be confused with single quotation (')
```

function calculateSquare(number) {
  return number * number;
}

// Example usage:
const num = 5;
const square = calculateSquare(num);
console.log(`The square of ${num} is ${square}`);

```

- When you can you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting to your codeblocks
```js

function calculateSquare(number) {
  return number * number;
}

// Example usage:
const num = 5;
const square = calculateSquare(num);
console.log(`The square of ${num} is ${square}`);

```

- Make note of where the backtick key is located.

- It should appear above the tab key but it may vary based on your keyboard layout.

Good Cloud Engineers use codeblocks for both Code and Error that appear in the console. 
```bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "This is a normal message."
echo "Another normal message."
non_existent_command
echo "This message will not be reached."

```
> Here is an example of using a codeblock for an error that appears in bash.

## Step 3 - Use GitHub Flavoured Task Lists

GitHub extends Markdown to have a list where you can check off items. <sup>[1]</sup>(#external-references)

- [ ] Finish Step 2
- [x] Finish Step 3

## Step 4 - Use Emojis (Optional)

GitHub Flavoured Markdown (GFM) supports emojis shortcodes.
Here are some examples:

| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:`	| :cloud: |
| Cloud with lightning | `:cloud_with_lightning:`	| :cloud_with_lightning: |

## Step 5 - How to create a table

You can use the following markdown format to create tables:

```md
| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:`	| ‚òÅÔ∏è: |
| Cloud with lightning | `:cloud_with_lightning:`	| üå©Ô∏è: |
```
GitHub extends the functionality of Markdown tables to provide more alignment and table cell formatting options. <sup>[2]</sup>(#external-references)
